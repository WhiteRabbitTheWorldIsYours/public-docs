# Start getting payments for your films

White Rabbit's RFR is a dashboard developed for rights holders. Setting up an account in the RFR is the first step to achieving viral distribution for your films.

In the RFR, you may register your film licenses, upload assets, set the price for different territories, and get revenue. You will always have complete control and ownership of your rights and data. The dashboard includes a comprehensive revenue overview, payments, sublicenses, and other vital insights.

### How to start getting payments for your film:

**Sign up:** Go to [dashboard.whiterabbit.one](https://dashboard.whiterabbit.one) Create a new account as a rightsholder.

**Upgrade to Level 2:** Level 2 ensures that your identity and company are, in fact, legit. Once upgraded to Level 2, you may access your films in the RFR.

Click the "Upgrade to Level 2" button on the dashboard. Fill out the necessary information and upgrade.

**Upgrade to Level 3:** You NEED to reach Level 3 to be able to distribute and collect payments for your films. All payments go directly from the customer to your wallet.

Click the "Upgrade to Level 3" button on the dashboard. Fill out or import your MetaMask wallet address. Then, click upgrade. If you don't have a MetaMask, install it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) and follow the instructions on the site.

Once your account is set up, you must register your films in the RFR to be able to distribute them through our network participants. Our network participants include partner streaming sites (PSS), decentralized applications (dApps), and social media influencers who are allowed to distribute the registered films. This way, a film registered in the RFR can potentially reach millions of people.

**Here is how to register your films:**

Search and select your films. Register and submit your film license by uploading the Chain of Title documents (CoTD) and selecting the correct windows and regions. We require CoTDs to assure us that you are, in fact, the legal rights holder of the film. Then, the CoTDs will be reviewed and approved (or declined) by a 3rd party legal entity shortly after.

(A Chain of Title is the series of legal documents or agreements that establishes proprietary rights or ownership in a motion picture or project, including documentary evidence of assignments, from its concept through completion and beyond.)

Once the Chain of Title documents are approved, you will get complete control of the distribution of your film. This includes revenue, payment history, price settings, sublicenses, and assets.

Next, you can proceed with uploading the assets. For now, this means the video file, subtitles, and poster. Keep in mind that the size of the file will influence the speed of uploading the film. Once you have uploaded the video file, the film will be distributed to the white rabbit network, and you can expect to see revenue coming in the next few days or weeks.

Note that once your film gets approved. We will automatically set a price for the regions and windows you are licensed for. However, you may actively change this by clicking "edit." If you decide to delete the price for a region and window, the film will be made private and will not be accessible to the white rabbit network. Therefore, you need to ensure a price is always set.
